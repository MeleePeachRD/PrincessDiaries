So you wanted to get serious with Peach? Well, this is just the thing you should probably read then. We will cover everything from subfloats and Q Drops to Float Cancelling and Turnip Throws to all High/Mid Tier MUs. This guide was made with the help of the people in the Peach R&D server. An invite link to the server will be included at the end.
